# Final Project 8: The recipe recommender

### Introduction

In today's fast-paced world, people are increasingly looking for quick, easy, and 
delicious meals to cook at home due to time issues or food cost. With so many recipe
 options available online, it can be challenging for users to find recipes that
 match their tastes and preferences. In this project, I aimed to solve this
 problem by building a recipe recommendation system using data analytics techniques.

### Plan
•	Acquire the data from data source
•	Importing the files in Python
	o	Preprocessing and cleaning the data
	o	Feature engineering for more developed features
	o	Exporting to MySQL for processing
•	MySQL
